         <p>
            Last summer I got very lucky at an auction where I managed to acquire a Minolta Autocord and a bunch of other cameras for only 400SEK (that&rsquo;s about $60 USD). In the box was also a Nikon FE2, Polaroid Land Camera 101 as well as a Contaflex II. All in super nice condition. There was also a Canon FTb or something, but that one was i terrible shape. Furthermore there were tons of different accessories.

      <h2><a href="https://iamsim.me/the-zeiss-ikon-nettar-516/2/">The Zeiss Ikon Nettar 516/2</a></h2>
      <div class="content">
         <p>
            For Christmas this year my fantastic girlfriend bought me a Zeiss Ikon Nettar 516&frasl;2. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;, you might ask. And it&rsquo;s a good question indeed.
The Nettar 516&frasl;2 is, from what I&rsquo;ve gathered, one of the rarest models in the Nettar series. A series of folding cameras produced by Zeiss Ikon during the 1930&rsquo;s and 1940&rsquo;s. It takes 120 film which is still wildly available today!
This particular model was produced around 1938 in Stuttgart, Germany.
