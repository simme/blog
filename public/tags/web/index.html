            Brent Simmons, of Vesper fame, just posed an interesting bunch of questions. About the structuring of bigger web applications. Since I&rsquo;m part of building one of those I thought I&rsquo;d share my thoughts on the matter.
In his post Brent talks about the pros and cons of splitting the different responsibilities up into different applications. I, for one, am a strong advocate of splitting it up.
This is the list of components he lists:

            Speaking of improving web experiences. You should check out Jank Free. A page from developers at Google promoting techniques for creating jank free (60fps) web experiences!
I can specifically recommend this video where they talk about how to use the Chrome dev tools to identify performance problems on your website.

            A while back I implemented a function on Bloglovin for synchronizing log out across multiple open windows. Ie. if you had multiple tabs open for Bloglovin and signed out in one of them we will sign you out in all of them. This is to avoid weird behavior for AJAX requests in &ldquo;still logged in tabs&rdquo; etc.
I first looked at the HTML5 postMessage API. But to use that you require a reference to the window you want to send a message to.
