            That last post made me want to do a post similar to what Stefan Laketa has done and write a more comprehensive list of the podcasts I currently listen to. Mainly for my own sake to look back at in a year or so and see how the list has changed.
Here we go, in order they currently appear in my podcast app:
 A Responsive Web Design Podcast — I&rsquo;ll be honest.

            Just wanted to write a quick post about one of my new favorite podcasts: Design Details! In which Brian Lovin and Bryn Jackson sit down and talk to fantastic designers. About design and life and what not. I&rsquo;m not a designer myself, but it&rsquo;s really enlightening to hear smart people talk about the subject.
What makes this show special is that all interviews are done in person. Which I believe adds another dimension to the show, compared to podcasts where the interview is conducted over Skype or similar.
