            Soroush Khanlou had a very interesting blog post a while back. In it he elaborates on his &ldquo;coordinator pattern&rdquo;. Its a very neat pattern in which you make all of your view controllers &ldquo;flow agnostic&rdquo;. Ie. they know nothing about the view controller hierarchy, when to push another view controller on the navigation stack, when to present a modal etc. All of that responsibility is delegated to a coordinator object.

      <div class="content">
         <p>
            Just today I had to replace a UILabel with a UITextView. The label was inside of a UIStackView that had its position pinned to the bottom of another view, hence growing upwards. I&rsquo;m doing all of this in Interface Builder btw. Just as I let go of the text view I&rsquo;ve dragged in I see that ominous red circle with an arrow show up. Indicating that there&rsquo;s some problem with my layout.

            Swift provides a protocol that you can conform to to let the world know that your objects or structs can be compared and found equal or not: Equatable.
There&rsquo;s also a protocol that allows you to use your objects as keys in a dictionary: Hashable.
In an app I&rsquo;m working on I&rsquo;m making some of the models (structs) conform to these procotols so that I can make diffing and such when refreshing the UI.

         <p>
            In the app I&rsquo;m currently working I have a view that asks its delegate for the locale to use when rendering it&rsquo;s model object.
The model has strings for all of the supported locales embeded in it and its just a matter of using the correct one when rendering.
The view itself can go through a number of different transitions which is why I need to ask the delegate a few times in a few different places for what locale to use.

            UIStackView introduced in iOS 9 is awesome. However, as someone coming from the HTML/CSS programming world I sometimes find that it does not really match up with the mental model I have of how it should work.
There&rsquo;s not any straight forward way of putting a number of absolutely sized items in a stack view and aligning them to either side. You can make them stretch to fill, distribute equally over the entire width of the stack view and you can center them.

            Here&rsquo;s a nice article that explains Reactive Cocoa in a very succint way. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever really get into this style of programming (mostly because I don&rsquo;t feel super comfortable basing an app entirely on third party frameworks). But I find it really fascinating and cool!

            Was about to tear my own hair off due to issue with UIStackView and autolayout. Here&rsquo;s a simplified version of my view hierarchy:
- UIStackView - MyCustomView - UILabel - MyCustomView - UILabel - MyCustomView - UILabel  The stack view are laying the custom views out in a horizontal fashion. Now, whenever I added a constraint similar to this:
let xConstraint = NSLayoutConstraint(item: label, attribute: .Left, relatedBy: .Equal, toItem: self, attribute: .

            I&rsquo;ve been spending some time diving into iOS development for reals during my spare time the last couple of months. In this time I&rsquo;ve come to learn a lot of things about storyboards, other than that they are pretty awesome.
Here are two things in particular.
Table View Data Sources and Delegates In the very first issue of objc.io they discuss how to make your UITableViewControllers lighter by moving data sources and delegates to separate objects.
