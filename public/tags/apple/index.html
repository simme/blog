            My collegue-for-another-month-and-a-half Jared Sinclair went to an Apple Store and tried on a few watches.
I have been interested in the link bracelet and I&rsquo;m not sure if his comments make me more or less interested in one. Although I think that the price of it has already made me more interested in the classic buckle.
Most of all I just want Apple to announce a shipping date for Sweden! Come on guys!

      <h2><a href="https://iamsim.me/the-obsolescence-of-the-apple-watch/">The Obsolescence of the Apple Watch</a></h2>
      <div class="content">
         <p>
            There&rsquo;s been some talk about the Apple Watch and how getting people to spend the big dollars on a gold watch might be a tough given how the technology inside of it will be &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; within just a year or two.
John Gruber writes on Daring Fireball:
 Itâ€™s a computer. And all computers have lifespans measured in just a handful of years before obsolescence. If you buy a $6,000 mechanical watch and take care of it, you can expect it to outlive you and become a family heirloom.
