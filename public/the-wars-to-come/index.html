      <h1>The Wars to Come</h1>
      <div class="content">
         <p>While the title is a Game of Thrones reference this post is not about the fantastic show on HBO. No, the title is a hint about my future. I mean, it might be a bit dramatic. But I&rsquo;ve come to embrace that side of my writing. Anyway, I was just failing for ways to begin this article. Now that it has begun I can concentrante on getting to the point.</p>

<p>Today I announced to the world that I am leaving my position as lead front-end developer at <a href="https://www,bloglovin.com">Bloglovin</a>. I&rsquo;ve had two amazing years at the company. I&rsquo;ve met tons of new cool people. I&rsquo;ve gotten to experience New York, many times! And I&rsquo;ve learned a shit load of stuff. Even though the company had existed for five years before I joined I still got to be there when things really took off. I joined right as the team started to expand beyond the five founders (fantastic people all of them) and just as we opened our New York office. It has been a hell of a ride and I&rsquo;ve been honored to be a part of building a product used by millions of people (I&rsquo;ve yet to actually grasp that notion — &ldquo;millions&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I have always had lots of own ideas of things I want to build. On my desktop there&rsquo;s a long list of app ideas and services that I&rsquo;ve never really had the time or energy to build. My plan now is to do freelancing to support the implementation of one or many of those ideas. I&rsquo;d like to be known as a great indie developer.</p>

<p>As always when one leaves what has become a group of dear friends there&rsquo;s a touch (a lot) of sadness involved. But at the same time I am super excited for the future. My last day at Bloglovin will be the 22nd of May and I&rsquo;ve already got some work lined up that I&rsquo;m excited to get started on.</p>

<p>(The title, of course, is referencing the heated discussions I will be having with clients about making text blink and IE6 support!)</p>
