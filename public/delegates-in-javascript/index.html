      <h1>Delegates in JavaScript</h1>
      <div class="content">
         <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever done any iOS or Mac development you&rsquo;re probably pretty familiar with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern">delegation pattern</a>. If you&rsquo;ve never set foot in Cocoa land you&rsquo;ve probably <em>never</em> heard about this (or at least not used it). Basically delegation is a way of specializing an object and removing certain &ldquo;business logic&rdquo; from it. For example, take the <code>UITableView</code> on iOS. That&rsquo;s the class responsible for displaying all those lists you see on the iPhone. It has a very &ldquo;simple&rdquo; mission: render a list of item (and manage scrolling, view reuse etc). An instance of <code>UITableView</code> knows nothing about the data it displays, or how it should be displayed. This is all up to the <code>dataSource</code> and <code>delegate</code> to figure out. Ie. the table view instance will <em>query</em> the <code>dataSource</code> for data and views to render.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDataSource_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html">data source protocol</a> defines a number of methods that a table view data source must or can implement. So, the table view asks the data source &ldquo;Hey, how many rows should I draw?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How high are the cells for each row?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Could I please have the cell for row 5 in section 2&rdquo;. Et cetera. (Nitpickers need not point out the fact that I took the data source instead of the actual delegate as an example. IMO the data source <em>is</em> a delegate, just another kind. Also made for a better example.)</p>

<p>This makes for very clean separation of responsibilities. The table view don&rsquo;t have to know anything about where the data comes from. Which makes it very easy to reuse the table view itself. Say you&rsquo;re building a Twitter client. There are many places you would show a timline, profile, main feed, list. All of them look the same, but the data comes from different places.</p>

<p>Anyway, lately I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with this concept in JavaScript. I guess that basically it&rsquo;s just another way of doing &ldquo;model -&gt; view&rdquo;. But say you wanted to build a generic list view for the web, a list view that could optimize for scrolling performance and usability, while not having to care about data at all. And then you modularize that and then all of a sudden you have a component you can reuse basically anywhere as long as you slap some extra methods on your model, or view model, or whatever, and you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>Kind of a rambly and weird post that didn&rsquo;t really go anywhere. I just feel like delegation could be a handy pattern that should be used more on the web. Instead of having a jQuery-plugin that just takes a <code>ul</code>-element already in the DOM you could have a component that acts upon a model.</p>
