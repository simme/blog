      <h1>My Watch and I</h1>
      <div class="content">
         <p>This started out as a 700+ word review of the Apple Watch. Then I read it and realized that I was just repeating what everyone else have already said about it. So, I threw it away. What remains is a short list of observations, still mostly echoing others.</p>

<ul>
<li>The try-on experience in the store was weird, but kind of fun.</li>
<li>I went with the classic leather buckle. Comfort wise it&rsquo;s comparable to the black sportband (which I also got). But I think the leather looks nicer.</li>
<li>The Milanese loop (which I tried in the store) was comfy, but pulled my arm hairs.</li>
<li>I went in thinking I&rsquo;d really want to buy the link bracelet (even though it was out of budget for me) but after trying it on I really didn&rsquo;t like the feel against my skin.</li>
<li>The watch has absolutely motivated me to move more and get some exercise. A slave to the circles.</li>
<li>Apps are really slow, I really don&rsquo;t use them. watchOS 2 hopefully fixes this.</li>
<li>Going for a run without the phone but still getting stats is <em>really nice</em>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m spending less time overall with my phone since I can triage most notifications from my wrist. And also I trust myself to notice notifications on the watch. On the phone it&rsquo;s so easy to miss things, which leads to some kind of angst that makes me pull it out of the pocket all the time. And once it&rsquo;s up it&rsquo;s so easy to get stuck on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. That just doesn&rsquo;t happen in the same way anymore.</li>
<li>I use the &ldquo;Now Playing&rdquo;-glance <em>all the time</em>. Being an avid podcast listener, mostly from the speaker in my pocket while out working on the farm, it is really useful. (I sometimes pause podcasts using my nose.. :S)</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s my new alarm clock on my bedside table (replacing the phone which is now not in the bedroom during the night). For no particular reason.</li>
<li>Siri works really well most of the time and I actually use it to set reminders, timers, call people and text people.</li>
<li>Battery life is really a non-issue. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gone one day where it was below 30% when I went to bed.</li>
<li>It has revolutionized nothing, but changed my life in so many tiny ways that it&rsquo;s now very annoying to not have it on.</li>
</ul>
