            This started out as a 700+ word review of the Apple Watch. Then I read it and realized that I was just repeating what everyone else have already said about it. So, I threw it away. What remains is a short list of observations, still mostly echoing others.
 The try-on experience in the store was weird, but kind of fun. I went with the classic leather buckle. Comfort wise it&rsquo;s comparable to the black sportband (which I also got).

            Was about to tear my own hair off due to issue with UIStackView and autolayout. Here&rsquo;s a simplified version of my view hierarchy:
- UIStackView - MyCustomView - UILabel - MyCustomView - UILabel - MyCustomView - UILabel  The stack view are laying the custom views out in a horizontal fashion. Now, whenever I added a constraint similar to this:
let xConstraint = NSLayoutConstraint(item: label, attribute: .Left, relatedBy: .Equal, toItem: self, attribute: .

            I&rsquo;ve been spending some time diving into iOS development for reals during my spare time the last couple of months. In this time I&rsquo;ve come to learn a lot of things about storyboards, other than that they are pretty awesome.
Here are two things in particular.
Table View Data Sources and Delegates In the very first issue of objc.io they discuss how to make your UITableViewControllers lighter by moving data sources and delegates to separate objects.

            My &ldquo;Mac App of the Week&rdquo;-award (not actually a weekly occurence) goes to Paw! Paw makes it super easy to try and debug web APIs!
You can save requests, group them, edit JSON in a nice way, easily exclude keys from JSON POST calls, view responses in different format, extend functionality with JavaScript. The list goes on.
If you&rsquo;ve ever used Postman for Chrome or if you&rsquo;re hacking away in your terminal with Curl, give Paw a go.

            A while back I saw the Trello CSS Guide swim around my Twitter timeline. I&rsquo;ve been using that style of writing CSS ever since, I&rsquo;ve even started to introduce it ever so slightly in the Bloglovin CSS (although converting a two year old project is not something you do in one go). I&rsquo;ve found the guide to result in very maintainable CSS code. It&rsquo;s even possible to make changes without being scared of breaking stuff, because it&rsquo;s all so neatly namespaced.

            I&rsquo;ve made an effort recently to get better at getting things done. At work we already have a list of stuff to do but at home there&rsquo;s an endless list of tasks that needs doing. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to spend half of Saturday just &ldquo;getting started&rdquo;.
Things have been on my Macs basically since it was launched. And on my iPhone since it was released on iOS a few years ago.

            My collegue-for-another-month-and-a-half Jared Sinclair went to an Apple Store and tried on a few watches.
I have been interested in the link bracelet and I&rsquo;m not sure if his comments make me more or less interested in one. Although I think that the price of it has already made me more interested in the classic buckle.
Most of all I just want Apple to announce a shipping date for Sweden! Come on guys!

            While the title is a Game of Thrones reference this post is not about the fantastic show on HBO. No, the title is a hint about my future. I mean, it might be a bit dramatic. But I&rsquo;ve come to embrace that side of my writing. Anyway, I was just failing for ways to begin this article. Now that it has begun I can concentrante on getting to the point.

            That last post made me want to do a post similar to what Stefan Laketa has done and write a more comprehensive list of the podcasts I currently listen to. Mainly for my own sake to look back at in a year or so and see how the list has changed.
Here we go, in order they currently appear in my podcast app:
 A Responsive Web Design Podcast — I&rsquo;ll be honest.

         <p>
            Just wanted to write a quick post about one of my new favorite podcasts: Design Details! In which Brian Lovin and Bryn Jackson sit down and talk to fantastic designers. About design and life and what not. I&rsquo;m not a designer myself, but it&rsquo;s really enlightening to hear smart people talk about the subject.
What makes this show special is that all interviews are done in person. Which I believe adds another dimension to the show, compared to podcasts where the interview is conducted over Skype or similar.
