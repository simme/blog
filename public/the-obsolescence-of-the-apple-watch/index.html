      <h1>The Obsolescence of the Apple Watch</h1>
      <div class="content">
         <p>There&rsquo;s been some talk about the <a href="http://apple.com/watch">Apple Watch</a> and how getting people to spend the big dollars on a gold watch might be a tough given how the technology inside of it will be &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; within just a year or two.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gruber">John Gruber</a> writes on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/09/apple_watch">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a computer. And all computers have lifespans measured in just a handful of years before obsolescence. If you buy a $6,000 mechanical watch and take care of it, you can expect it to outlive you and become a family heirloom. Paying even $1,000, let alone a multiple of that, for a premium Apple Watch seems like folly if it’s going to be obviated by faster, sleeker, longer-lasting versions in just a few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also talk about it on the <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/83">latest episode</a> of <a href="http://atp.fm/">ATP</a>.</p>

<p>A thought that struck me when reading Gruber&rsquo;s post was that given how the chip in the Apple Watch, <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/technology/#chip">the S1</a>, contains everything: is it too far of a stretch to think that they might offer upgrades?</p>

<p>Of course future models will get thinner and slicker. But maybe even that&rsquo;ll come to be a status symbol: &ldquo;I had the first Apple Watch!&rdquo;. People will see that it is bigger then every newer model.</p>

<p>I realize that this kind of upgrading would be an unprecedented move by Apple. So why would they do this? Firstly, it&rsquo;s a way of fighting the negativity that comes with all the talk of obsolesence. If they promised upgradability for a forseeable future that&rsquo;d probably encourage a few extra people to get the gold.</p>

<p>And while they wouldn&rsquo;t get to sell another $10k watch to some rich dude they could probably have pretty high margins on an <em>S2</em>. Since they&rsquo;ll be mass produced on a completely different scale then the gold cases are. The super rich people will probably pay for a new one anyway, given how they&rsquo;ll want to own the newest and shiniest Apple gear.</p>

<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t think Apple will actually offer upgrading. If they are it&rsquo;s weird that they haven&rsquo;t said so. Although they might be holding that back until they release the actual pricing. It&rsquo;s an interesting thought though and not completely unplausible.</p>
