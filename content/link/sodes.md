My old colleague [Jared](https://twitter.com/jaredsinclair) released his new app ['sodes][Sodes] today. It's a podcast player for the casual podcast listener.

Now, to be frank, this is not the podcast app for me. I still like [Castro][Castro] a lot and it suits my listening habits much better. But I can't help but adore the design. It's apparent that Jared has put a lot of care into the layout and interactions. I kind of wish it was aimed at the more serious listener. But alas, it's fantastic in it's simpleness.

If you're pod-curious or someone who just listens to podcasts in a more laidback way I suggest you try ['sodes][Sodes].

This [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sodes_app/status/956418530014126081) highlights a few of the features in a nice way too if you want to learn more first.
