tricot is, and has been, my favorite band for quite some time now. This new single and music video is.. well. The music video is great, love the feel and style. The song itself hasn't stuck in my head straight away like [Melon Soda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=405wuDhww9U) did a year ago. I do really like it towards the end though, and I think it'll grow on me. Looking forward to the [EP being released](http://www.topshelfrecords.co.uk/products/615191-tricot-potage-on-the-boom#) here in the EU.

I realize that math rock is not everyone's cup of tea. Especially not when the singing is done in Japanese. Music in foreign language seem to turn a lot of people off. Maybe those who like lyrics I guess? :)
