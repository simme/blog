The fantastic folks over at [objc.io](https://www.objc.io/) are almost done with their book on iOS App Architecture. I got the early access program and must say that the book is shaping up to be really interesting.

Last week they released the videos accompanying the book, that you get access to if you pay a little extra. I've watched a few of them so far and they're really, really great.

Highly recommended for anyone who does iOS programming. Even if you're satsified with the way you're building apps now I bet you'll find a lot of useful stuff in there!
