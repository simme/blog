Tangerine is the first habit tracker that I've been able to really stick with. It's a pretty new app but came out of the
gates strong. If you're looking for an app to help you keep on track with all your 2020 resolutions[^1] I can't recommend
Tangerine enough.

I have a few quibbles of course. Like completing a task after midnight breaks your streak. I understand the reasons for
this. The developer is aware and is looking to solving this in the future. Great news for us night owls!

I have not gone for the subscription yet. But once I have a little more data to get real benefits from the additional
graphs and insights I will.


[^1]: If you resolutions work great for you, awesome! But if they don't (they never did for me) I recommend checking out [yearly themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) instead.
