Added a Screen Time limit to social media apps on my iPhone. Set it to an hour. It had the interesting side effect of
shortening my Instagram sessions because I want to preserve my precious time. Same with Facebook and Twitter. It almost
completely killed the aimless scrolling. Made each app visit more "purposeful". Will probably slowely try to decrease
the time week by week.
