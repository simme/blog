When reading through my [latest post][codestories] again I just realized that I think I'm a pretty "visual" programmer.
In the way that if the code _looks_ messy my brain have a hard time deciphering it. I like to add inline function
documentation just as a way to create visual separators between bits of logic in my code. Never really thought about
that before.
