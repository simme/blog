I had written up a pretty lengthy article on my use of Coordinators in iOS apps. Along comes Matt Gallagher and shakes
my world view with his approach to [view-state driven applications](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/view-state-driven-applications.html).
Currently reconsidering the role of Coordiantors in my apps. Still want to write that article.
