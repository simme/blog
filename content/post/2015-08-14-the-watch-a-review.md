This started out as a 700+ word review of the Apple Watch. Then I read it and realized that I was just repeating what everyone else have already said about it. So, I threw it away. What remains is a short list of observations, still mostly echoing others.

* The try-on experience in the store was weird, but kind of fun.
* I went with the classic leather buckle. Comfort wise it's comparable to the black sportband (which I also got). But I think the leather looks nicer.
* The Milanese loop (which I tried in the store) was comfy, but pulled my arm hairs.
* I went in thinking I'd really want to buy the link bracelet (even though it was out of budget for me) but after trying it on I really didn't like the feel against my skin.
* The watch has absolutely motivated me to move more and get some exercise. A slave to the circles.
* Apps are really slow, I really don't use them. watchOS 2 hopefully fixes this.
* Going for a run without the phone but still getting stats is _really nice_.
* I'm spending less time overall with my phone since I can triage most notifications from my wrist. And also I trust myself to notice notifications on the watch. On the phone it's so easy to miss things, which leads to some kind of angst that makes me pull it out of the pocket all the time. And once it's up it's so easy to get stuck on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. That just doesn't happen in the same way anymore.
* I use the "Now Playing"-glance _all the time_. Being an avid podcast listener, mostly from the speaker in my pocket while out working on the farm, it is really useful. (I sometimes pause podcasts using my nose.. :S)
* It's my new alarm clock on my bedside table (replacing the phone which is now not in the bedroom during the night). For no particular reason.
* Siri works really well most of the time and I actually use it to set reminders, timers, call people and text people.
* Battery life is really a non-issue. I don't think I've gone one day where it was below 30% when I went to bed.
* It has revolutionized nothing, but changed my life in so many tiny ways that it's now very annoying to not have it on.
