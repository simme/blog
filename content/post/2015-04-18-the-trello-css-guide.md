A while back I saw the [Trello CSS Guide](https://gist.github.com/bobbygrace/9e961e8982f42eb91b80) swim around my Twitter timeline. I've been using that style of writing CSS ever since, I've even started to introduce it ever so slightly in the Bloglovin CSS (although converting a two year old project is not something you do in one go). I've found the guide to result in _very_ maintainable CSS code. It's even possible to make changes without being scared of breaking stuff, because it's all so neatly namespaced.

End of message.
