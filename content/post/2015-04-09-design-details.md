Just wanted to write a quick post about one of my new favorite podcasts: [Design Details](http://www.designdetails.fm)! In which [Brian Lovin](https://twitter.com/brian_lovin) and [Bryn Jackson](https://twitter.com/uberbryn) sit down and talk to fantastic designers. About design and life and what not. I'm not a designer myself, but it's really enlightening to hear smart people talk about the subject.

What makes this show special is that all interviews are done in person. Which I believe adds another dimension to the show, compared to podcasts where the interview is conducted over Skype or similar. I think they do a great job of capturing that _"intimacy"_ that occur when you have an in-person conversation. Plus they are all pretty smart! Not dummies, as they'd say in one of my other [favorite podcasts](http://www.imore.com/debug).

So, you should totally go subscribe in your [podcast player](https://overcast.fm/podcasts) of choice, if you are so inclined. I started out at episode ten and have yet to go through the backlog. But I'm gonna!

Bonus points for super catchy theme song.
