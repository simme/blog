Speaking of improving web experiences. You should check out [Jank Free](http://jankfree.org). A page from developers at Google promoting techniques for creating jank free (60fps) web experiences!

I can specifically recommend [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8ep4leoN9A) where they talk about how to use the Chrome dev tools to identify performance problems on your website.
