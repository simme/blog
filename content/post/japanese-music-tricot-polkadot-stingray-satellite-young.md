In this post I'd like to share three Japanese bands that I discovered this year that have all found a recurring place in my playlists.

I've found that overall Japanese music works well for me while working, because I can't ([yet][learning-japanese]) understand the lyrics. So I don't get caught up in listening to the words.

Without further ado.

## tricot

Early this year I stumbled upon [tricot][tricot], and immediately fell in love. The first two songs I heard were [Pool][pool] and [Tobe][tobe]. Both somehow reminded me of [At the Drive In][atd], something about the feeling and sound.

It's hard to describe their style. A lot of electric guitars and intense drums. Their Wikipedia article describes them as a "math rock" band. I'm not too familiar with that genre. It's rock/punk sort of, but with weird rhythms and melodies.

Later this year they released their third album, aptly named [3][3]. According to Spotify it has been my most listened to album — by far. I had it on repeat for a couple of weeks after it was released. The first track, [Tokyo Vampire Hotel][tvh] (check out the [Music video][tvhmv]), kicks things right off, but it's not only full speed ahead. "3" contains a number of more chill tracks as well.

My favorite track of the album is the last one, [Melon Soda][ms]. It's melodic, full of feeling. The base line is super cozy and keeps the pulse through the entire song. Just love this one.  The [music video][msmv] is great too!

I like almost all of tricot's songs. They are fantastically talented musicians. Just check this studio recording of the song [Niwa][nms]. Since The Mars Volta shut down, these women has climbed to the number one spot on my "bands I really want to see live"-list. Judging from the recordings on YouTube, people in their crowds are standing _way_ too still.

## Satellite Young

Gear switch. We're no longer in rock territory. We've been transported back 25 years. Seems like we're sometime in the 80s.

[Satellite Young][sy] is a fairly new addition to my music roster. They showed up in my Discover Weekly playlist on Spotify the other week.

I've long been a fan of cheesy eighties synth-pop and this band really strikes a synth-pad-chord on my Moog-harp-heart. Bands like [The Midnight](midnight), [Futurecop!][futurecop] and [Mitch Murder][mm] have circulated my playlists for a long time now. An addition to this genre from Japan was most welcome.

The song that Spotify had added to my weekly playlist was, [Don't Graduate, Senpai!][dgs]. After the first 10 seconds I had to interrupt whatever I was working on to take a closer at the band.

The [self-titled album][sya] has a bunch of great songs, and a feature by Mitch Murder. If you like synths and retro-wave, this might be for you.

## Polkadot Stingray

Back to the rock with another recent find; Polkadot Stingray. Their style is a bit more straight forward, compared to tricot. The first track I fell for was [エレクトリック・パブリック][ep] (Electric Public). Which seems fitting as the base player from tricot, Hiromi Sagane, guests on it.

I am by no means a music reviewer, so if you'd like a more in-depth analysis of their first album I recommend you read [Japanese rock band Polkadot Stingray have a voice to be heard][psr] by [Patrick St. Michel][mbmelodies].

>  Yet don’t let the hook distract from the small details, like when everything slows down and teeters towards reggae, or the sudden jazzy twists. It’s a fitting intro to the group, as it is a zippy number highlighting the band’s musical chops and radio-ready centers, but with all sorts of weirder details on the sides.

The upbeat funky style just hit home for me and I am looking forward to hearing more from them!

## Honorary Mention: Babymetal

Late last year I was actively searching YouTube for some J-pop and got served the video for BABYMETAL's [Gimme Chocolate!!][gc]. Clearly a product of the Japanese [Idol Culture][ic], engineered to push just the right buttons in my brain. I was a fan from there on.

I mean, how charming are three girls acting tough as hell singing metal (with a heavy dose of pop mixed in). And, these girls are talented. The lead singer has _fantastic_ range.

The [Road of Resistance][rorl] live performance is just a fantastic rock anthem. The 20.000 people crowd does nothing but add to the epic feeling. Those mosh pits are _not_ to be taken lightly. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention [The One][one]. Just epic.

I'm seriously impressed by these girls. Also a band on my "bands I really want to see live"-list. Many (presumably white male) metal-fans seem offended by them. _"This is not metal!"_ Well, I'm not ashamed to admit that I honestly think BABYMETAL are awesome.
