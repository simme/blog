My collegue-for-another-month-and-a-half [Jared Sinclair](https://jaredsinclair.com/) went to an Apple Store and [tried on a few watches](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/116388033340/apple-watch-try-on-unsorted-thoughts).

I have been interested in the link bracelet and I'm not sure if his comments make me more or _less_ interested in one. Although I think that the price of it has already made me more interested in the classic buckle.

Most of all I just want Apple to announce a shipping date for Sweden! Come on guys!!
