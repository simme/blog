We have known each other for half of our lives. Been together for just a little less — almost 16 years. That's a pretty long time, both in relative and absolute terms. However, the time has come to part ways. Having grown up together it will be a little like learning to stand again, but on one leg because the other leg walked off in another direction.

Sara and I have made countless of beautiful memories together. Our journey has been lined with hardship and sorrow. Even though this is the end of that particular journey, at least it is the happiest of endings. It has all been worth it and I don't regret a thing.

We remain the bestest of friends and will undoubtedly continue to make beautiful memories in the future — just not every day. There are no words to describe the love I've felt, and still feel, for Sara. All I can say is it's still the same amount or more, just a different kind.

The practical details aren't yet all figured out, but I will remain in the house on the country side outside Gothenburg. In February Sara will move to Malmö and eventually Copenhagen as they pursue their new dream. Pim (the bus) will stay with me, always ready to take Sara on an adventure should they want to. I'll keep at least one of the dogs and both cats.

I'm excited to find out what my new future holds! I guess I'll find out, flailing around on one leg.
