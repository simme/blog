[Great article](http://nomothetis.svbtle.com/you-are-more-than-a-coder) by [Alexandros Salazar](http://nomothetis.svbtle.com):

> Neither are we engineers or scientists. We don’t design physical objects; we don’t care about gravity, electricity, or magnetism; evolutions is irrelevant to us; neuroscience is a mystery. We create in an abstract world that interacts, in points, with the concrete, but that is separate from it. We manipulate ideas; we transform data; we process knowledge; we present concepts. Under it all, no matter how we dress things up, what we do is invent new ways to move around zeros and ones. There’s a name for our kind: we are mathematicians.

You should read it!
