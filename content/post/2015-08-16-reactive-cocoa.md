Here's a [nice article](http://nomothetis.svbtle.com/an-introduction-to-reactivecocoa) that explains Reactive Cocoa in a very succint way. I don't think I'll ever really get into this style of programming (mostly because I don't feel super comfortable basing an app entirely on third party frameworks). But I find it really fascinating and cool!
