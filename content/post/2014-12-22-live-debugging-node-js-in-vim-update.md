Just wanted to post a super quick update! Since posting my [article](/live-debugging-node-js-in-vim) a few months back there's been some activity in the repository for the [node-vim-debugger](https://github.com/sidorares/node-vim-debugger)!

Looks amazing!

(If I was the kind of person to take credit for stuff I'd like to imagine that I sparked the burst of development creating an issue. Luckliy I'm very humble and would never do such a thing. ;))
