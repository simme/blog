My "Mac App of the Week"-award (not actually a weekly occurence) goes to [Paw](https://luckymarmot.com/paw)! Paw makes it super easy to try and debug web APIs!

You can save requests, group them, edit JSON in a nice way, easily exclude keys from JSON POST calls, view responses in different format, extend functionality with JavaScript. The list goes on.

If you've ever used Postman for Chrome or if you're hacking away in your terminal with Curl, give Paw a go. There's a thirty day trial with no locked down functionality so there's nothing to lose. For $30 it's a steal!
